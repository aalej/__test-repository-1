        Have a usage question?
        =======================
        We get lots of those and we love helping you, but GitHub is not the best place for them and they will be closed. Please take a look at the [Firebase CLI documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/) first: 
        If the official documentation doesn't help, try asking through our official [support channel](https://firebase.google.com/support/).
        You can also post a question on[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) with the `firebase` tag.
        
        Have a backend, console, and other non-CLI issues?
